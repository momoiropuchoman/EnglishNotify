The file is like the format as below.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

apple - a hard round fruit that has red, light green, or yellow skin and is white inside

Gently I reach to the side and pluck an apple off the tree, then drop it.



lemon - a fruit with a hard yellow skin and sour juice

There are indeed times when a lemon as a seasoning seems second only in importance to salt.



orange - a round fruit that has a thick orange skin and is divided into parts inside

Oranges are a good source of Vitamin C.
